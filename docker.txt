A Docker Swarm is a group of either physical or virtual machines that are running the Docker application and that have been configured to join together in a cluster.

Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers

Docker Compose: 
By using docker compose we can run multiple containers.

Docker Volume:

It is used for persisting the data used and generated by docker containers.

Docker Container:

Docker containers are lightweight and consists of executable package of s/w that includes each and everything to run an application.

Docker Image:

Set of instruction to build a docker container.

Docker file:

Docker file is a text file of instruction to build  a docker image.

Docker:

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run application with the help of containers.

Docker Commands:

1. docker –version

This command is used to get the currently installed version of docker.
2. docker pull

Usage: docker pull <image name>

This command is used to pull images from the docker repository(hub.docker.com)

3. docker run

Usage: docker run -it -d <image name>

This command is used to create a container from an image

4. docker ps

This command is used to list the running containers

5. docker ps -a

This command is used to show all the running and exited containers

6. docker exec

Usage: docker exec -it <container id> bash

This command is used to access the running container

7. docker stop

Usage: docker stop <container id>

This command stops a running container

8. docker kill

Usage: docker kill <container id>

This command kills the container by stopping its execution immediately.

Difference b/w stop and kill:

The difference between ‘docker kill’ and ‘docker stop’ is that ‘docker stop’ gives the container time to shutdown gracefully

11. docker push

Usage: docker push <username/image name>

This command is used to push an image to the docker hub repository

12. docker images

This command lists all the locally stored docker images

13. docker rm

Usage: docker rm <container id>

This command is used to delete a stopped container.

14. docker rmi

Usage: docker rmi <image-id>

This command is used to delete an image from local storage

15. docker build

Usage: docker build <path to docker file>

This command is used to build an image from a specified docker file
